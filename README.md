# Chatroom
This is a beginner project I did to learn about RUST. It is a simple chatroom running on the local machine where users can join and and chat to each other. Whispers are supported with the ```/w <recipient> <message>``` format.

## How to run

**Preq:** Cargo

1. Clone the repository
2. Open a terminal and run ```cargo run -p server```
3. Open 1 or more terminals and in them run ```cargo run -p client```
4. Play around!
